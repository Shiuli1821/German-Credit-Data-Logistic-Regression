# German-Credit-Data-Logistic-Regression
Identifying Good & Bad Customers for Granting Credit
This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.You will need to apply Logistic Regression (using Statsmodel Library) to build model to predict which customer is likely to be classified as bad or good. You will use “Creditability” as your Response Variable while rest of the variables as your Predictor Variables.It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad, than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good.So while you build a classification model, you should not only focus on accuracy but also keep a tab on False Positive & False Negative as well.
